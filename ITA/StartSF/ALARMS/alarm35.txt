If the pump is faulty there will be a "Low fuel pressure" problem 
This problem arises if the pump "breaks up" internally causing swarf and iron filings to get into the fuel system 
Normally this causes damage to the diesel injectors and unless the complete fuel system is attended to the problem will arise again 
This is an expensive failure and no short cuts can be taken
